# ngSpotify

This is pretty simple.  In the service, get albums.  In the artist page, display and style them.


The file structure looks like this (same as last time):
```
.
|-- app.component.html
|-- app.component.ts
|-- app.module.ts
|-- app.routing.ts
|-- components
|   |-- about
|   |   |-- about.component.html
|   |   `-- about.component.ts
|   |-- artist
|   |   |-- artist.componenent.js
|   |   `-- artist.component.html
|   |-- navbar
|   |   |-- navbar.component.html
|   |   `-- navbar.component.ts
|   `-- search
|       |-- search.component.html
|       `-- search.component.ts
|-- models
|   |-- Album.js

`-- services
    `-- spotify.service.ts
```
